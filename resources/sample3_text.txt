The ship tilted sharply.

Water splashed onto the deck.

Sailors shouted to each other.

The storm grew stronger.

A massive wave hit the bow.

The ship fought against the wind.

Everyone struggled to stay balanced.

Minutes felt like hours.

Slowly, the storm began to weaken.

Clouds drifted away.

Sunlight returned to the sky.

The crew sighed with relief.

The captain thanked his sailors for their bravery.
