A group of hikers explored a distant mountain trail.

The air was thin and cold.

Snow covered the higher peaks.

They carried heavy backpacks.

A river flowed beside the trail.

Birds circled above them.

The hikers crossed a narrow bridge.

One of them slipped.

Others helped him stand.

They continued walking.

A distant rumble echoed.

The mountain seemed unstable.

Small rocks began falling.

The hikers hurried forward.

The sound grew louder.

A landslide started.

Dust filled the air.

They ran as fast as they could.

The trail curved sharply.

They reached a safe cliffside area.

Everyone gasped for breath.

The landslide passed.

Silence returned.

The hikers rested.

They drank water.

The river calmed them.

They watched birds glide across the valley.

Cool wind brushed their faces.

They prepared to continue the journey.

Their confidence returned.

The mountain no longer felt threatening.
